# Associative Data Models: Summary of Findings

This document summarizes the context from the article ["The Links Theory 0.0.2"](https://habr.com/ru/articles/895896) and identifies related projects and articles on associative data models, excluding standard graphs (no edges between edges) and relational models (typically too many tables). The findings focus on projects and resources not mentioned in the original article, suitable for researchers and developers exploring associative data structures for AI and beyond.

## Context from "The Links Theory 0.0.2"

The article, published on Habr, introduces "The Links Theory 0.0.2," a framework for a unified informational theory inspired by human associative memory, aimed at future AI data storage. Key points include:

- **Purpose**: Develop a simpler data model using set theory (\`L \to L^2\`), with doublet-links (2-tuples) and triplet-links (3-tuples) for efficient data representation and deduplication.
- **Comparison**: Outperforms relational algebra and graph theory, with implementations like Deep (PostgreSQL-based) and plans for LinksPlatform (Rust, offering 200x write, 1000x read improvements).
- **Features**: Includes visual tools (link blueprint designer, H-tree fractal demo) and future plans for self-projection and comparisons with set theory, type theory, etc.
- **Resources**: References Wikipedia ([Associative Model Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20210814063207/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_model_of_data)), GitHub repositories, and community channels (Telegram, Deep.Foundation blog).

The associative model stores entities as items and relationships as links, supporting higher-order connections (links to links), unlike graphs or multi-table relational databases.

## Identified Projects

Below are projects aligned with associative data models, not mentioned in the article:
