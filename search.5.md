# Associative Data Models with Edge-to-Edge Linking

This document summarizes projects, frameworks, and academic models related to a pure **associative data model** where everything is a link. In these models, there is no fundamental distinction between nodes and edges: all elements are links, and links may directly connect to other links. The first table lists systems and models that strictly adhere to this single-level associative paradigm. The second table includes related approaches that, although influential, generally use additional structures (like reification or node–edge separation) to support meta-linking.

## I. Strict Associative (Links-Only) Models

These projects and models implement a uniform “everything-is-a-link” approach. They natively support edges between edges (or links between links) without relying on additional layers (e.g., tables, typed nodes, or extra reification).

## II. Additional Related Models and Approaches

These entries describe approaches that are related to the associative model but typically introduce extra layers (such as reification) or divide data into nodes and edges—even if they support some form of meta-linking.

> **Notes:**
>
> - **Strict Models:** The entries in the first table strictly adhere to a uniform, links-only model. These systems do not distinguish between data nodes and relationships, making it possible to implement direct edge-to-edge linking.
> - **Related Approaches:** The entries in the second table are included as they have inspired or relate to the idea of associative linking. However, most of these models employ reification or maintain a conceptual separation between nodes and edges, and therefore do not fully meet the strict criteria.
> - Some entries (e.g., **Sentences** and **X10SYS/AtomicDB**) are historical or proprietary examples that, while influential, are not available as open source. Their inclusion provides context for the evolution of associative models.
>
> This compilation is intended as a starting point for deeper exploration into a single-level associative data model and its various implementations and theoretical underpinnings.
