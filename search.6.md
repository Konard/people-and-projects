# Associative Data Models: Projects and Resources

This document summarizes projects and articles related to associative data models, inspired by the article ["The Links Theory 0.0.2"](https://habr.com/ru/articles/895896). The focus is on models that support complex relationships, excluding standard graphs (no edges between edges) and relational models (often using too many tables). The findings include projects and articles not mentioned in the original article, providing a starting point for further exploration.

## Context

The article ["The Links Theory 0.0.2"](https://habr.com/ru/articles/895896), published on Habr, introduces a framework for comparing data models using set theory, aiming for a unified informational theory for future AI. It emphasizes associative memory, using doublet-links (2-tuples) and triplet-links (3-tuples) to represent data structures efficiently. The theory compares favorably to relational algebra and graph theory, with implementations like Deep and plans for LinksPlatform, offering significant performance improvements. The associative model, as defined in an [archived Wikipedia page](https://web.archive.org/web/20210814063207/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_model_of_data), stores entities as items and relationships as links, supporting higher-order connections.

## Projects

Below are projects identified as relevant to associative data models, not mentioned in the original article:

| Project | Description | Relevance | URL |
|---------|-------------|----------|-----|
| **CQL (Categorical Query Language)** | Open-source tool using category theory for data integration, ensuring data integrity via functorial migrations. | Aligns with mathematical foundations like set theory, supporting complex relationships. | [CQL Website](https://categoricaldata.net/) |
| **HyperGraphDB** | Open-source hypergraph database for AI and semantic web, allowing edges to connect multiple nodes or edges. | Supports higher-order relationships, fitting associative model requirements. | [HyperGraphDB Website](https://hypergraphdb.org/) |
| **TypeDB** | Open-source hypergraph database for knowledge representation, modeling complex interconnected data. | Enables advanced relationships beyond standard graphs, meeting user criteria. | [TypeDB Website](https://vaticle.com/typedb) |
| **Graphbrain** | Semantic hypergraph database for natural language processing, storing complex relationships. | Focuses on recursive, n-ary connections, similar to associative links. | [Graphbrain Documentation](https://graphbrain.net/overview/hypergraph.html) |
| **AtomicDB** | Associative database storing unique instances once, managing associations. Possibly inactive. | Directly implements associative model concepts. | [AtomicDBOnline](https://www.atomicdbonline.com/) |
| **Qlikview** | BI tool with an associative data model for dynamic data exploration, linking tables by field names. | Offers associative approach for analysis, though focused on BI. | [Qlik Community](https://community.qlik.com/t5/QlikView-App-Dev/QlikView-Associative-Model-Explained-A-perspective-on-R3DM/td-p/1256548) |
