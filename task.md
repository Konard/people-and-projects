https://habr.com/ru/articles/895896 - please get context from this article, and find me similar articles or projects, that are not mentioned.

I search for associative projects or people doing something to that respect. I do not consider graphs as associative as they do not allow edges between edges. I do not consider relational model as associative as it not used as associative model, usually to many tables are used.

Hypergraphs are out of the scope as they do not allow edges between edges too.

Let's start by only english.

I need people or projects or articles or systems that are close to associative data model or the links theory described in the article.
